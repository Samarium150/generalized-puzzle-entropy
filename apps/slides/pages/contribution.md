- Found the mathematical connection between the old algorithm, Minimum Uniform Solution Entropy [[Chen et al., 2023](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AIIDE/article/view/27499/27272)] and probabilities
- Proposed two new algorithms by generalizing old algorithms based on the connection found
    - Minimum Solution Information
    - Total Solution Information
- Proposed two new inference rules for the game, _The Witness_
- Verified machine learning model is capable of learning inference rules and be used in proposed algorithms
- Developed a puzzle editor that supports exhaustive procedural content generation (EPCG) queries
